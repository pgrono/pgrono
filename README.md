### 🚀 When I'm not coding:

I love to travel with my family, hike in the mountains, [attend rock concerts](https://www.setlist.fm/attended/pgrono), go cycling, and unwind with a [good movie or TV series](https://filmowy.pl/profil/piotrek).

🌍 Traveling | 🏔️ Hiking | 🎶 Rock Concerts | 🚲 Cycling | 🎬 Movies & TV Shows
